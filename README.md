# to-do-app : To build the simple backend TODO app
## Requirements

mysql database

checkout TodoMVC 

assume that the frontend will make request to backend for every single operation, build all endpoints to service the FE based on that assumption

## Good to have but not required

ajv with express input validation

setup ci/cd with travis (easiest) or with buildkite (use free plan)

get familiar with git tag, git flow, github flow, ci/cd etc
